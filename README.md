## Machine Reading Comprehension

## Attention Mechanism
[An Introductory Survey on Attention Mechanisms in NLP Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05544)

[Modeling Localness for Self-Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10182)

## Machine Translation
[DTMT: A Novel Deep Transition Architecture for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07807.pdf)
- Contributions
  - Tap the potential strength of deep transition between consecutive hidden states and propose a novel deep transition RNN-based architecture for NMT
  - Propose a simple yet more effective linear transformation enhanced GRU for our deep transition RNMT, which provides a linear transformation path for deep transition of consecutive hidden states.
